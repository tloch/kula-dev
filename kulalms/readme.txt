== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS extensions or themes, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure they’re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [documentation](https://lifterlms.readme.io/) and [knowledgebase](https://lifterlms.com/docs/).


#### I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?

Users of the free LifterLMS should post their questions in the plugin's WordPress.org forum. If you find you're not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider purchasing a [LifterLMS Pro license](https://lifterlms.com/product/lifterlms-pro).

If you're already a LifterLMS Pro user or you have purchased one of the LifterLMS themes or extensions, you're entitled to log into your account and contact the support team directly on the [LifterLMS website](https://lifterlms.com/my-account/). We can provide a deeper level of support here and address your needs on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 12 business hours.


#### LifterLMS is awesome! Can you set it all up for me?

Yes. You can get an instant quote for the team at LifterLMS to set everything up for you through our signature Boost service. Get an instant quote through our automated quote generation tool on the [LifterLMS website services page](https://lifterlms.com/done-for-you-lms/).


#### I'm interested in LifterLMS Pro, another LifterLMS extension, or a LifterLMS theme, but there are a few questions I've got before making the purchase. Can you help me get those addressed?

Absolutely. If you're not finding your questions answered on the product pages, you can ask your presales questions through this [contact form](https://lifterlms.com/contact/). You can also connect live with a member of our team [here](https://lifterlms.com/contact/).


#### What add-ons are available for LifterLMS, and where can I read more about them?

Currently, the following add-ons are available for LifterLMS:

+ [LifterLMS Stripe Payment Gateway](https://lifterlms.com/product/stripe-extension/), for accepting credit card payments directly on your website and passing the money through Stripe to your bank account.
+ [LifterLMS MailChimp](https://lifterlms.com/product/mailchimp-extension/), for adding your users to a MailChimp email list and organizing them into groups or adding to separate email lists based on the courses they’ve enrolled in.

-----------------------

**This is a massive update which _breaks_ backwards compatibility for many LifterLMS features. A database migration is also necessary for upgrading users to reformat certain pieces of information which are being accessed differently in 3.0.0**

**We strongly recommend that you backup your website before upgrading and, if possible, test LifterLMS 3.0.0 in a non-public-facing testing environment to ensure compatibility with your theme and other plugins and to ensure that 3.0.0 changes do not adversely affect your existing website.**

**Please thoroughly read the following changelog and, if necessary, submit support tickets or post in the forums with any questions _prior_ to upgrading. LifterLMS Support _cannot_ and _will not_ manually resolve migration issues which may arise from upgrading to 3.0.0.**

+ New shortcodes to be documented later, checkout "includes/class.llms.shortcodes.php" if you're feeling anxious
+ All kinds of CSS changes to make LifterLMS, in general, be a little less old looking
+ Added a number of CSS classes to various areas in the Checkout template at "templates/checkout/form-checkout.php"
+ Added a "Cancel" button that allows you to hide the coupon form if the user decides not to add a coupon
+ Removed jQuery animations from the coupon form toggle in favor of a CSS class toggle. If you decide you want some animations on the form add some CSS transitions to the `.llms-coupon-entry` element (and children) to change when the class `.active` is added or removed from the element.
+ Refactored JavaScript related to LifterLMS Checkout. Improvements are minimal (if any) but the file is now smaller and more readable! Yay code stuff.
+ Fixed some redundant text on single payment confirmation screen. ("Single payment of single payment of")
+ Added a link to memberships listed under "My Memberships" on the LifterLMS Account Screen
+ LifterLMS Order posts have been renamed in the database from "order" to "llms_order" to prevent any potential conflicts with other plugins. Automated database migration will handle the renaming of old orders.
+ Fixed undefined variable notice generated by Sections without any lessons inside of them
+ renamed function `add_query_var_product_id()` to `llms_add_query_var_product_id()`
+ added a class for interacting with a course TRACK, instatiated by a track term or term_id (`LLMS_Track`)
+ password strength meter and related settings / options via utilizing WordPress password strength functions available
+ cleaned up the lesson locked tooltips to be a bit more sane and also utilized in course navigation on individual lessons.

+ Courses (replaces includes/class.llms.course.php)
+ Lessons (replaces includes/class.llms.lesson.php)

  + _Recurring Payments Discount_ -- Applies only to recurring payment coupons. Determines the discount applied all payments (other than the first) of a recurring payment transaction.
  + _Description_ -- Record internal notes for a coupon visible only by admins on the admin panel
+ The "Coupon Code" field has been removed in favor of the WordPress Coupon Post Title being utilized as the code.

+ Charts! I'm really excited about this. I know we still need more data but please say nice things to me, I worked really hard on these little charts.
+ Updated styles & interface

##### bbPress

+ Restrict individual forums (and their topics) to LifterLMS Membership levels

##### BuddyPress

+ Fixes broken course display on bp profile
+ Adds memberships subpage to bp profile

##### notices

+ Admin notices class for managing admin notices, it's pretty neat!

##### Student Management on Courses and Memberships

+ All new and improved student management interface for managing student enrollments from courses and memberhips

##### Deprecated

+ filter: `llms_meta_fields_course_main`, replace with `llms_metabox_fields_lifterlms_course_options`

##### Manual Payments

+ Manual Payment Gateway can now be enabled on the frontend!
+ When a manual payment is recorded the user will be redirected to a view order page where they will be prompted to make a manual payment
+ Define the payment instructions on the admin panel "Checkout Settings"
+ Once you verify payment, head to the pending order and hit the "Record a Manual Payment" button to record the transaction
+ Upon recording the order status will be upgraded to "Complete" and the user will be enrolled automatically

##### Student Dashboard Upgrades

+ More sane template hooks and functions
+ Pagination on Courses endpoint (view only a preview on the mian dashboard)
+ Orders history & view orders screens!



Deprecated options (and related functons where applicaple) for the following course & membership options:

  + `lifterlms_button_purchase_membership_custom_text`
  + `lifterlms_course_display_outline_lesson_thumbnails`
  + `lifterlms_course_display_author`
  + `lifterlms_course_display_banner`
  + `lifterlms_course_display_difficulty`
  + `lifterlms_course_display_length`
  + `lifterlms_course_display_categories`
  + `lifterlms_course_display_tags`
  + `lifterlms_course_display_tracks`
  + `lifterlms_lesson_nav_display_excerpt`
  + `lifterlms_course_display_outline`
  + `lifterlms_course_display_outline_titles`
  + `lifterlms_course_display_outline_lesson_thumbnails`
  + `lifterlms_display_lesson_complete_placeholders`
  + `redirect_to_checkout`

In all scenarions either a `add_filter` (returning false) or a `remove_action()` can be used to replicate the option.


= v3.0.0-beta.4 - 2016/09/01 =
-------------------------------

+ fix issue with course prereq checks
+ next payment due date visible on order admin view
+ trial end date visible on order admin view

##### Free Access Plans

+ "Free" access plans now defined as such based on a checkbox rather than by entering 0 into the price
+ Only single payment access plans can be free (a free recurring payment makes no sense but we can certainly discuss this if you disagree with me)
+ trials are disabled with free plans (because trials only apply to recurring plans)
+ sales are disabled for free access plans

##### Checkout Form JS API

+ unified JS checkout handler
+ allows extensions to enqueue validation or pre-submission JS functions that should run prior to checkout form submission

##### Manual Payment Gateway

+ handles purchase of access plans marked ar FREE & orders that are discounted to 100% via coupons




##### Open Enrollment

+ Open Enrollment allows users to register on the account dashboard without purchasing a course
+ Voucher settings are available to customize whether vouchers should be optional or required during open registration
+ Better error reporting around voucher usage during enrollment

##### Deprecated Functions

+ `llms_get_coupon()`
+ `get_section_id()`
+ `check_course_capacity()`


##### Quizzes

+ Updated admin metaboxes to use new metabox abstract class
+ display 0 instead of negative attempts on quiz summary
+ updated logic in start button template

##### Emails (for engagements)

+ Admin metabox updated to new API
+ Postmeta data migration:
  + `_email_subject` renamed to `_llms_email_subject`
  + `_email_heading` renamed to `_llms_email_heading`


= v2.7.12 - 2016/09/22 =
------------------------

+ Added a new filter on content returned after port permission checks
+ Added additional information to plugin update message in preparation for major 3.0 release
+ Updated plugin contributor metadata


= v2.7.11 - 2016/07/22 =
------------------------

+ Removed a duplicate action hook on course archive loop.
+ Switched registration template include to use a more sane function
+ Added updated banner adds with prettier ones. Wooooooo.


= v2.7.10 - 2016/07/19 =
------------------------

+ Fix undefined noticed related to LifterLMS custom post type archive filtering
+ Fix filter which was supposed to allow custom engagment types to be queried & triggered by engagements automatically but was passing data incorrectly

= v2.7.9 - 2016/07/11 =
-----------------------

+ We are now properly storing delayed engagment trigger data.
+ Fixed an issue with our engagment query functions that caused, in very rare circumstances, the extra engagements to be triggered during an engagment trigger due to a lack of specificity in our query
+ Fixed an undefined property notice related to email engagments when the email had no subject or header
+ Fixed a typo in the description of a translation function.
+ Added an engagment debug logging function. You can log all sorts of data related to engagements by adding `define( 'LLMS_ENGAGEMENT_DEBUG', true );` to your `wp-config.php` file.
+ Allow course title shortcode to be used on course pages (and quizzes too). Documentation incorrectly said it was available on courses so we've fixed the function to allow for use on courses.


= v2.7.8 - 2016/07/05 =
-----------------------

+ Bugfix: Restore access to quiz results on quiz completion


= v2.7.7 - 2016/07/01 =
-----------------------

##### Russian

+ LifterLMS is now 100% Translated into Russian thanks to our new Russian Translation Editor [@kellerpt](https://profiles.wordpress.org/kellerpt/)

##### l18n

+ All transition messages between questions during a Quiz are now translatable.
+ LifterLMS subpages below the LifterLMS icon on the admin panel will now always display regardless of how you've chosen to translate the menu items. Hopefully puts to rest a long-standing i18n issue.

###### Bug fixes

+ Attempting to access a quiz when not enrolled in the associated course and having not properly started the quiz now results in a useful error message rather than a PHP warning.
+ We've adjusted the way we're adding a admin panel "seperator" to reduce conflicts with other plugins that have menu items with the same position as our seperator (51).
+ Added new logic to display an error message (instead of nothing) if there's an error during question loading.
+ Resolve issue with course progress bar when added to a quiz sidebar (assuming your theme has sidebar support on your quizzes).
+ Updated version number in the changelog for last version (it was supposed to be 2.7.6)


= v2.7.6 - 2016/06/28 =
-----------------------

+ Students manually removed by Memberships by using the "Students" tab of a LifterLMS Membership will now be fully removed from the membership.
+ Updated a few time-related strings to be l18n friendly. These items were all around Quiz time reporting and quiz time limits.
+ Updated testing information, tested up to WP 4.5.3
+ Fixed date of last release on changelog. It had the wrong date. Does that really matter?
+ Updated readme.txt description area, we have a new youtube video! Yassss.


= v2.7.5 - 2016/06/13 =
-----------------------

##### New features
+ Added an "id" parameter to both LifterLMS Courses and LifterLMS Memberships shortcodes

##### i18n
+ Allow date translation on quiz results screen by using `date_i18n()` instead of `date()`
+ Allow date translation on my courses screen by using `date_i18n()` instead of `date()`
+ Ensure course status "Enrolled" is translatable on my courses screen

##### Fixes
+ Thanks to [@kjohnson](https://github.com/kjohnson) who fixed undefined index warnings & errors which occurred when viewing the last lesson in a section when the next section contained no lessons.
+ Resolved an issue where formatting for "Restricted Access Description" course content would not display proper formatting.
+ Fixed an issue with the "FREE" stamp for a free lesson caused layout issues.
+ Removed the "is-complete" css class from incorrectly being added to lesson preview tiles for free lessons
+ Fix an escaping issue when rendering Course titles inside LifterLMS notices. Prevents "\'s" from displaying when "'s" should be displaying (and similar issues).


= v2.7.4 - 2016/05/26 =
-----------------------

+ Fixed a bug with the new localization methods from 2.7.3
+ Removed bundled it_IT translation files in favor of official language pack available at [https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/lifterlms/language-packs](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/lifterlms/language-packs).
+ Removed bundled en_US translation files because LifterLMS is in English so the files are unnecessary.
+ Fixed a few mis-labled filters applied when registering LifterLMS Custom Post Types
+ Adjusted the default supported features of LifterLMS Quizzes and Questions
  + Quizzes now support custom fields as per user request
  + Commenting, thumbnails, and excerpts are no longer "supported" as they were never intended to be and were never correctly implemented.
    + If you are relying on any of these features for your quizzes or questions please use the following filters to re-implement these features: `lifterlms_register_post_type_quiz` or `lifterlms_register_post_type_question`. These will allow you filter the default arguments LifterLMS passes to the WordPress function `register_post_type()`


= v2.7.3 - 2016/05/23 =
-----------------------

+ Added a separate filter for login redirects `lifterlms_login_redirect` and added the user_id as a second parameter available to the filter
+ Added second parameter to `lifterlms_registration_redirect` to allow access to the registered users's user_id
+ Fixed a timestamp conversion issue on Course sale price checks that caused indefinite sales (those with no date restrictions) to appear not on sale during certain periods of time. The period would differe depending on the server's timezone settings and the time of visit.
+ Added a "Pointer" when hovering quiz summary accordion to allow for a slightly more obvious user experience that the elements are expandable.
+ Added some new localization methods to ensure strings that only appear in Javascript files will be translator friendly. This initially fixes a few issues on the Quiz Summary page and during quiz taking where strings only appeared in Javascript and were, therefore, completely inaccessible to translators.


= v2.7.2 - 2016/05/19 =
-----------------------

+ In course syllabus widget & shortcodes free lessons will now be clickable links.
+ Record `llms_last_login` timestamp in usermeta when a user registers.


= v2.7.1 - 2016/05/09 =
-----------------------

##### Enrollment & Voucher Checks

+ Enrollment functions will now automatically check to ensure that users are not already enrolled in a course or membership before enrolling. This addresses an issue which would create double enrollment for user redeeming a voucher for a product they were already enrolled in.
+ Vouchers will now automatically check to see if the user has already redeemed this voucher before allowing the user to redeem it. This would have caused multiple enrollments and would allow one user to eat up an entire voucher by using it over and over again for funsies. A voucher can now *only* be redeemed once by a user as intended.
+ `llms_is_user_enrolled()` now allows developers to check membership enrollment. Previously this function would only check enrollemnt of Courses despite what the documentation stated.

##### Translation

+ 3 strings have had translation functions added to them. This makes LifterLMS voucher reemptions translatable!

##### Bugs & Fixes

+ Fix javascript dependency & enqueueing issue on admin panel which prevented LifterLMS settings from saving correctly in various places
+ Removed inline CSS from "next lesson button" on quiz completion / summary screen. This was overriding some default styles and making the button very thin and gross.


= v2.7.0 - 2016/05/05 =
-----------------------

##### LifterLMS Custom User Fields Exposed

+ Custom fields added during registration via LifterLMS account settings are now exposed on the admin panel via the student's WordPress user profile
+ All custom fields that are available (billing and phone) are editable on the WordPress user profile by anyone with profile edit access regardless of LifterLMS settings. If the settings are disabled (eg not required for registration) you can still add this information manually to a user's profile. This is useful if you require the information and then disable it later, you would still be able to access the information on the admin panel but would no longer be required for user's during registration.
+ A few new filters added to help developers customize the experience here. Check out the documentation at [https://lifterlms.com/docs/lifterlms-filters/#admin-user-custom-fields](https://lifterlms.com/docs/lifterlms-filters/#admin-user-custom-fields)

##### Membership Manual Add & Remove Student Functions

+ Duplicated "Students" tab from the Course admin screen to Memberships
  + Students can be manually added to a membership by an admin
  + Students can be removed manually from a membership by an admin

##### Updates

+ Added the ability for students to edit their phone number via their account settings page if the phone number registration option is enabled on the site.

##### Fixes

+ Fixed a few spelling errors on LifterLMS admin panel order screens
+ Fixed a typo on meta data for LifterLMS admin created (manual) orders


= v2.6.3 - 2016/05/02 =
-----------------------

+ Removed redirecting action from WooCommerce integration that was causing issues on mutliple product purchase checkouts with larger databases.
+ Added a new payment action `lifterlms_order_complete` which runs at the same time as some previous actions during payment processing but servers a different purpose. This is mostly in preparation for a forthcoming AffiliateWP integration.
+ Fixed an issue with LifterLMS certificate background image that caused the wrong dimensions to be returned when outputing a LifterLMS certificate background image


= v2.6.2 - 2016/04/27 =
-----------------------

+ Fix class conflict in collapsible course outline widget template which caused some UX issues.
+ Added new filters run during course & lesson sidebar registration to allow customization of LifterLMS sidebars
  + `lifterlms_register_course_sidebar`
  + `lifterlms_register_lesson_sidebar`
+ Removed a stray logging function.
+ Cleaned up some undefined variable warnings & notices on the quiz summary template
+ Fixed an issue appearing when registering users did not submit the optional phone number which caused a PHP notice
+ LifterLMS Orders generated by WooCommerce will now have a payment method of "WooCommerce". This also addresses an undefined notice produced during WooCommerce order completion because a LifterLMS Payment Method wasn't being defined.


= v2.6.1 - 2016/04/26 =
-----------------------

+ Fix class conflict in collapsible course outline widget template which caused some UX issues.


= v2.6.0 - 2016/04/25 =
-----------------------

##### Collapsible Course Outline Widget

+ By request we've added an option to make your course outline widgets collapsible!
+ View feature [Documentation](https://lifterlms.com/docs/course-syllabus-widget/)
+ New translations available related to feature. I think it's 4 strings.

##### Bug Fixes

+ Removed an unused CSS selector that caused some issues on the admin panel. This resolves an issue identified with the Page Builder by SiteOrigin plugin. The selector was very generic (`.title`) and may have caused issues with other themes or plugins using that class.
+ Resolved an issue that prevented post update, save, and publishing messages for core post types (posts, pages) from displaying properly.


= v2.5.1 - 2016/04/22 =
-----------------------

+ Fixed session handler initilization as it was being initialized prior to user data availability.
+ Staged `LLMS_Language` class  for deprecation in favor of WordPress translation functions `__()`, `_e()`, etc... **If you're a developer you'll start seeing warning's on screen or in your logs if you're using this function, it will be completely removed in the next MAJOR release (3.0.0)**
+ Added a new function to handle the deprecation warning above (`llms_deprecated_function`) and now that we have this function we'll start deprecating all the things. Just kidding, or am I?
+ This gives translators access to 69 new strings that were previously untranslatable! However, this number might be innacurate +/- 5 strings. I only counted it once and I don't feel like the exact number is important enough for a recount to ensure accuracy. /shrug


= v2.5.0 - 2016/04/15 =
-----------------------

**Admin Panel Order Table Updates**

+ Several visual improvements to the table
+ Exposed the following fields on the table
  + Order number
  + Customer name (with a link to their WP profile)
  + Customer email (mailto link)
  + Payment gateway used (this is filterable per gateway as well so gateways can improve the functionality here in the future)
+ Added a link to the product edit page from the product column
+ Free orders will now display as "Free" as opposed to {currency}0.00
+ Removed the not-so-useful "Order" column which was a long ugly string of data that was displayed in other columns already
+ Removed the "Password Protected" flag since *all* orders are always automatically password protected for added security. This flag distracts from the interface so we've removed it. Orders _are_ still password protected though.
+ Numerous strings that were previously not translatable have been made translatable on this screen
+ A few new strings that previously didn't exist are now available for translation

**Fixes and other small changes**

+ Fixed a translation issue on the LifterLMS menu that we thought we fixed in the last release but have now really fixed (probably).
+ Fixed a few small issues with engagements as they related to external engagements triggered by other plugins and LifterLMS extensions.
+ Tired of seeing a banner for a plugin you've already installed? We have your back! The general settings area will now only display banners for plugins that aren't installed.
+ Fixed various javascript issues, mostly removed `console.log()` statements.
+ Fixed a spelling error on the membership admin panel settings screen


= v2.4.1 - 2016/04/07 =
-----------------------

+ Tested and compatible with WordPress 4.5 Release Candidate.
+ Fixed a pagination issue related to updates to the quiz builder from 2.4.0 which would cause results to return incorrect results on the last page of paginated results in the "Add Question" dropdown.
+ Added translation functions to LifterLMS Menu Items. Resolves an issue where translated LifterLMS installations might not see all the menu items under the LifterLMS Icon.
+ Italian translation updates curtosey of [@AndreaBarghigiani](https://github.com/AndreaBarghigiani)
+ On some themes the "Next Lesson" button was displayed while quizzes were being taken. We now *always* hide the next lesson button when a quiz is being taken.
+ Adjusted some static functions to be non static in `class.llms.post-types.php`
+ Added a function to ensure support for post thumbnails on LifterLMS custom post types
+ If a user views a course that is available to them because it belongs to a membership level they are a member of, course pricing information will no longer be visible. This addresses a confusing user experience issue. Previously it _appeared_ like payment for a course was still required even though it really wasn't.
+ Fixed undefined variable warning on quiz summary screen
+ Resolve an issue with quiz timer that caused issues on time display if the time limit was set to a fraction of a minute (eg 1.5 minutes)
+ resolved an undefined variable warning resulting from courses still holding a reference to a membership after the membership has been deleted or trashed


= v2.4.0 - 2016/03/29 =
-----------------------

##### Performance Improvements on the LifterLMS Quiz Builder

+ Completely rewrote Javascript associated with building a LifterLMS Quiz. Our users have been identifying some performance issues and slowness when working with larger databases. We've refactored the Javascript and our related database queries to allow faster quiz building and fewer timeouts when working in the quiz builder.
+ Fixed a bunch of undefined variables that would produce PHP warnings in various quiz templates
+ Added validation to quiz questions on the admin panel to prevent the same question from being added to a quiz multiple times.
+ Fixed an issue that prevented quizzes from correctly marking the lesson as completed when the quiz was passed.
+ Added three new actions now available for developers to hook into.
  + `lifterlms_quiz_completed` called upon completion of a quiz (regardless of grade)
  + `lifterlms_quiz_passed` called when a quiz is completed with a passing grade
  + `lifterlms_quiz_failed` called when a quiz is completed with a failing grade
+ Course Progress and Course Syllabus shortcodes (and widgets) now work on Quiz pages
+ Completed Metabox refactor for the LifterLMS Quiz post type and removed `LLMS_Meta_Box_Quiz_General` class. All functions now exist in `LLMS_Meta_Box_Quiz`
+ Added validation to the Quiz general settings
  + Cannot only enter numbers in attempts, percentage, and time limit fields
  + Cannot enter a negative number or a number greater than 100 in the percentage field
+ Removed the membership restriction metabox from quiz admin and question admin screens

##### Other fixes

+ Fixed an issue that caused multiple certificates awarded for the same Course or Lesson to not properly display on the My Account page.
+ Removed an event bound to the publishing of a LifterLMS Question that called a function that didn't exist and caused a Javascript error on the console (but didn't actually cause any problems)
+ Removed a warning message that would display on sidebars when a shortcode was being displayed in a place that it couldn't function. We now simply don't display any content if the shortcode can't function.
+ Resolved an issue that prevent users from "purchasing" products when using a 100% coupon and the Stripe payment gateway. Users experiencing this issue should also update to Stripe 3.0.1.
+ Fixed an AJAX related issue that was incompatible with PHP7
+ Added the ability to have a "max" value on LifterLMS Admin Metabox number fields


= v2.3.0 - 2016/03/24 =
-----------------------

##### Engagements Refactoring (lots of bugfixes, performance improvements, more hook & filter friendly)

+ We've completely rewritten the LifterLMS Engagement Handler methods (`class LLMS_Engagements`) and added some new engagement actions.
+ The rewrite unifies engagement handling into one function that can be easily hooked into by plugin and theme developers.
+ We've moved any engagment related data out of the main `LifterLMS` class
+ Fixed the broken engagement delay functionality which now runs of `wp_schedule_single_event`. This makes the function more reliable and also keeps it within the traditional WordPress architecture.
+ Added an additional check before sending emails or triggering any engagments that will prevent the achievement from being awarded or the email from being sent if the post is in not published. This fixes an issue that caused emails in the trash from still being emailed.
+ Removed the unused `LLMS_Engagements` class and file
+ Added two new engagment trigger events "Membership Purchased" and "Course Purchased"
+ Deprecated actions -- Removes some redundancy because the triggering actions (`lifterlms_course_completed` triggered the notification action, instead `lifterlms_course_completed` simply triggers the engagement now).
  + `lifterlms_lesson_completed_notification`
  + `lifterlms_section_completed_notification`
  + `lifterlms_course_completed_notification`
  + `lifterlms_course_track_completed_notification`
  + `lifterlms_course_completed_notification`
  + `lifterlms_user_purchased_product_notification`
  + `lifterlms_created_person_notification`

##### Bug and Issue fixes

+ Adjusted the size of the LifterLMS Admin Menu Icon. It was super big because of, perhaps, some overcompensation. It caused an issue on Gravity Forms admin pages for some reason (we didn't ever determine why) but we've resolved it by using an appropriately sized icon.
+ Fixed a CSS issue that caused some weirdness on the course archive page on mobile devices
+ Fixed an issue with automated membership expirations
+ Fixed a function that should have been called statically in `LLMS_Ajax` class
+ Fixed a ton of issues related to the triggering of engagements and cleaned up a lot of classes and functions associated with them.
+ Properly instatiate `LifterLMS` singleton via LLMS() function and prevent direct instantiation of the class via `new LifterLMS()`.
+ Removed the deprecated 'class.llms.email.person.new.php' file as it was rendered useless a long time ago and caused some duplicate emails.


= v2.2.3 - 2016/03/15 =
-----------------------

##### Translations

+ Added translation functions around quite a few untranslated strings. Thanks to the team at [Netzstrategen](http://netzstrategen.com)
+ Added German translation .mo and .po files again thanks to the team at [Netzstrategen](http://netzstrategen.com)

##### Student Enrollment Functions

We've refactored a bit of our code related to how to programmatically enroll a student in a course or membership during registration and purchase.

A new class `LLMS_Student` makes working with a LifterLMS student (user) a bit easier. We'll begin exposing user meta data through this class as we continue to improve the usability of the codebase for other developers.

We've also created a simple enrollment function `llms_enroll_student()` which enables programmatic enrollment to LifterLMS courses or memberships. This was previously handled in a pretty schizophrenic manner and this unifies various ways of enrollment into one clean function. All enrollment moving forward will use this functions.

The enrollment function calls a new action as well as calling existing enrollment-related actions:

+ `before_llms_user_enrollment` - called immediately prior to begining the user enrollment function
+ `llms_user_enrolled_in_course` (previously existing)
+ `llms_user_added_to_membership_level` (previously existing)

This also addresses an issue that prevented the `llms_user_enrolled_in_course` action from being called when a user was auto-enrolled in a course because they joined a membership level that included auto-enrollment in one or more courses.

##### Bug and Issue fixes

+ Fixed an inconsistency in the way membership IDs were being saved to the postmeta table that would cause courses to not *appear* restricted on the Membership Enrollment tab, even though they were actually restricted and functioning correctly.
+ New lines are now preserved in the quiz question clarification text areas, thanks to @atimmer
+ Escape HTML in the quiz question description fields on the admin panel to allow outputting html without rendering it, thanks @atimmer
+ Fixed an issue related to the outputting of restricted course and membership content which caused errors on certain themes
+ added a clearfix to the `.llms-lesson-preview` element on the course syllabus template
+ Removed the `class.llms.person.handler.php` file as it wasn't actually being used by anything anywhere and contained no functions
+ Removed some unused and depreacted class functions from the LLMS Student Metabox class
+ Fixed an undefined javascript error resulting from code cleanup in 2.2.2. This issue prevented Vouchers from being published. The code has been further cleaned.


= v2.2.2 - 2016/03/15 =
-----------------------

##### One step closer to a public GitHub repository

We've made a assive syntatical update to almost every file in the codebase for a (finally) unified and clearly defined coding standard. This puts us one step closer to beginning to open our GitHub repo publicly and accepting pull requests and contributions from developers everywhere.

Okay, we haven't exactly _clearly_ defined it yet. We're working off a modified version of the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/).

Notable exceptions are related to file names because Thomas Levy didn't have the energy to rename a bunch of files as well as ignoring the Yoda Conditions standards. We'll be fixing these deviations in the future.

##### Quizzes

+ Created new time calculation and humanizing functions related to the display of quiz time on quiz results pages
+ Quizzes will now display hours, minutes, and seconds depending on the time it took to take the quiz
+ Timing calculations are more accurate and quizzes that are completed in less than 60 seconds will not bug out and display incredibly long lengths
+ Resolved an issue that occassionally prevented quiz data from saving during the last question causing the quiz to hang in an uncompletable state
+ Quiz questions now have a default point value of 1, thanks @atimmer
+ Quiz question answers now accept valid HTML as per `wp_kses_post`, thanks again to @atimmer

##### Translations

+ Thanks to @AndreaBarghigiani and the team at [codeat](http://codeat.co/) LifterLMS now ships with Italian language files!

##### Issue and bug resolutions

+ Fixed a restriction issue that would happen when individual lessons were restricted to a membership level
+ Fixed an issue with the `[lifterlms_my_account]` shortcode that was preventing the shortcode from working on the Divi theme.
+ Engagements will now only be triggered if they are "Published". Resolves an issue where draft or trashed engagements were still firing.
+ Fixed CSS overflow on LifterLMS Meta boxes. Fixes an issue where select boxes would be hidden inside a metabox.
+ Changed the ConvertKit extension banner image on the LifterLMS general settings page and replaced added a link to the extension now that it's available.
+ Added a link to the new ConvertKit extension to the .org readme
+ When restricting an entire site to a membership level the page selected as the "Terms and Conditions" page in LifterLMS settings will automatically bypass Membership restriction settings. This will allow your unregistered users to actually read the T&C that they're confirming during registration.
+ CSS fix for `has-icon` class on course syllabus
+ Fixed a PHP warning that displayed when purchasing a membership with no auto-enrollment courses
+ Fixed an undefined variable warning in the WooCommerce integration class
+ Fixed a few templating issues related to certificates
+ Added a few new CSS rules that should make certificates more compatible across various themes
+ Added a css class to LifterLMS Next Lesson buttons, `llms-next-lesson`
+ Updated the scheduled event name for cleaning up LifterLMS session data from the WP database. It had a conflicting name with the scheduled event for expiring LifterLMS memberships.

= v2.2.1 - 2016/03/07 =
-----------------------

+ Added a few actions to the `class.llms.voucher.php` class.


= v2.2.0 - 2016/03/04 =
-----------------------

##### Translations

+ We've updated our .pot file for the first time in quite a while. We're really sorry for de-emphasizing translation. An updated .pot file will now accompany each version of LifterLMS whenever a translatable string is adjusted or when a new string is added.
+ We've also made it easier to include custom translations. Read our [Translation Guide](https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/getting-started-with-translation).

##### Certificate Background Images

_We've completely rewritten the certificates template (but it's all backwards compatible)._

+ New filters are available to make customizing the certificate template easier for developers. All new filters are documented at [https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/functions-certificates](https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/functions-certificates).
+ A new WordPress Image Size is now available and will be used for generating the image used by default when uploading certificates to the media library. Fore more information on these new settings visit [https://lifterlms.com/docs/certificate-background-image-sizes/](https://lifterlms.com/docs/certificate-background-image-sizes/).

##### Course and Membership Pricing & Sales

+ Sale price start and end date are now completely optional.
  + Provide neither a start date nor an end date to have a sale run indefinetly
  + Provide a start date with no end date to have a sale start at a pre-determined time with no pre-determined ending
  + Provide an end date with no start date to have a sale end a a pre-determined date but start immediately
  + Provide a start date and an end date to have a sale run for a pre-determined period of time
+ Optimized the `LLMS_Product` class to provide more reliable and extenable use of the class
+ The templates related to pricing functions have been refactored. Affected templates include: "templates/course/price.php", "templates/loop/price.php", "templates/membership/price.php"
+ Many people complained about the size of the `.llms-price` element on course and membership tiles on loop pages. We removed the inflated size and will now default to your theme for sizing. You selector remains the same if you wish to customize the size of the price text.

##### Coupon Updates

+ Coupons can (finally) be removed after being applied!
+ Coupons can now be restricted to specific courses and/or memberships
+ Percentage based coupons can no longer be created with a value larger than 100%
+ Added numeric restrictions to usage and coupon amount fieds on the admin panel
+ Fixed a programmatic error that prevented product restrictions from being entirely removed
+ Fixed a few instances where hardcoded a US Dollar symbol ($) where a dynamic currency symbol should have been displayed.

##### Wow Bad Syntax, Very Typo, Such Grammar, So Undefined

+ Fixed a typo in filter associated with modifying the registration of the lesson post type (`lifterlms_register_post_type_lesson`)
+ Fixed a grammatical error in a Membership restriction message
+ Fixed a syntax error in "/templates/course/outline-list-small.php" that prevented the `done` CSS class from being properly applied to completed lessons

+ Added `the_content` filter to the content of emails sent by LifterLMS
+ Fixed some CSS issues on Voucher screens
+ Updated Courses settings retrieval function to retrieve the correct "shop" page id
+ Added translation functions to voucher export meta box class
+ Vouchers Export metabox will only allow export after a voucher has been published. This prevent's an issue caused by attempting to export voucher codes before they were saved in the database via the publish / save action.
+ Vouchers can no longer be saved with a use of "0"
+ added a CSS class for various syllabus outputs that notes that the lesson has an icon. Previously CSS relied on "is-complete" to output styles for having an icon but with the addition of placeholders the "is-complete" is used only to note that the lesson is completed and "has-icon" is a more semantic class that applies to both complete and incomplete lessons with an icon.
+ Removed the membership restriction metabox from some post types where it shouldn't have been displaying.
+ admin select fields now have an option `allow_null` (default to "true") which can be set to `false` in order to prevent the output of the default "None" option

###### Enhancements

= v2.0.0 - 2016/02/04 =
-----------------------

+ You can now add courses to and remove courses from a Membership from the Membership itself
+ You can now opt to automatically enroll students in a course (or multiple courses) when they sign up for a membership by checking "Auto Enroll" next to the course on the Membership enrollment tab

##### Student Enrollment & Removal on Courses Admin Screen

We've updated the Students tab interface for performance and usability!

+ AJAX enabled searching by student name and or email
+ Increased performance for course page load by only calling student information when needed. This resolves a bug identified by users with large user databases and/or low-powered servers.
+ Allow for addition or removal of several students at a time.

##### Syllabus Template

+ Added a Course setting to optionally enable Lesson Thumbnails on the Course Syllabus
+ Added a Course setting Display greyed out lesson completion checkmark icons on lessons not competed in the course syllabus

+ "Humbled" the metabox on all post types that restricts the post to a membership. The metabox would previously gain priority over the WordPress publishing actions metabox. The priority has been reduced to "default" and will to fall into line with all other metaboxes on the screen and appear based on registration priority. If you can't find the metabox, SCROLL DOWN! If you want to put it back up on the top, you can simply drag it up there and WordPress will save your preference.

##### Deprecated Classes

We've added a "deprecated" file which holds a few stubs for classes and functions deprecated below as to prevent fatal errors. The functions and classes in the deprecated class are classes which we know are being utilized by approved LifterLMS extensions and will allow users to upgrade LifterLMS without upgrade extensions without breaking their websites!

+ `LLMS_Activate` which as previously used to activate the plugin for updates via the LifterLMS Update Server and is no longer required.
+ PUC (plugin update checker) Library has been completely removed as it is no longer required for plugin updates.
+ `LLMS_Analytics_Dashboard` was removed as it was a stub that was never used and shouldn't have ever been released as a part of the LifterLMS codebase. I can't believe no one reported this bug!

##### Deprecated Functions

+  `lifterlms_template_section_syllabus()`

**The following are officiallby deprecated and removed to prevent WooCommerce compatibility conflicts**

= v1.5.0 - 2016/01/22 =
-----------------------

##### WooCommerce Integration Enhancements

__NOTE: The following enhancements only apply when the WooCommerce Integration is enabled__

**Always redirect to the WooCommerce Cart when a SKU Matched Product can be found**

+ LifterLMS Products (courses and memberships) which are SKU matched to a WooCommerce product will now automatically add the related WooCommerce product to the WooCommerce shopping cart and then automatically redirect the visitor to the WooCommerce cart when the visitor attempts to enroll in a course or membership from the LifterLMS course or membership page.
+ If no WooCommerce product is found via a SKU match, the user will proceed to the LifterLMS checkout.
+ This will enable you to determine which Cart you want a user to use on a product by product basis. You may sell certain courses via WooCommerce and others via LifterLMS (should you choose to do so).

**Multiple Item Checkout**

+ When a WooCommerce order is complete user's will now be automatically enrolled in **all** courses and/or memberships in the WooCommerce order. This improves upon a previously limitation that would only allow WooCommerce checkout with one LifterLMS product at a time.
+ The products in the order will be intelligently SKU matched to LifterLMS Courses or Memberships.
+ You may also mix and match between WooCommerce products matched to LifterLMS products and those which are not matched to LifterLMS products. For example, your customers may now buy a Course via SKU matching as well as a T-Shirt that is not matched to a LifterLMS course via a SKU.

##### Other Fixes and improvements

+ Fixed a bug that caused quiz results to display for users who had never taken the quiz.
+ Added Wistia as an oEmbed provider to fix an issue related to default oembed handling in WordPress 4.4.
+ added a `.cc_cvv` class that mimics the existing `#cc_cvv` styles to allow gateway extensions to change the ID of the field in their credit card forms
+ Added support for new 1.4.5 capability fixes to be also be reflected under the "+New" menu item in the WP Admin Bar. There are no changes to the filters, the capability filters will simply also remove restricted post types from the admin bar now (as they should).
+ Tested and compatible up to WordPress 4.4.1

##### Deprecations

**The following functions have been staged for deprecation in LifterLMS 2.0!**

+ Setup the `is_account_page()` function to be replaced by `is_llms_account_page()` function. The original causes conflicts when WooCommerce is installed as WooCommerce includes a core function by the same name. All references to `is_account_page()` in LifterLMS have been removed and the original has been left to prevent issues with developers currently relying on the LifterLMS version of thefunction.
+ Setup the `is_checkout()` function to be replaced by `is_llms_checkout()` function. The original causes conflicts when WooCommerce is installed as WooCommerce includes a core function by the same name. All references to `is_checkout()` in LifterLMS have been removed and the original has been left to prevent issues with developers currently relying on the LifterLMS version of thefunction.

= v1.4.5 - 2016/01/13 =
-----------------------

+ Significant improvements to LifterLMS admin permissions as well as a hardening of permissions. Previously LifterLMS admin screens and menus were available to any users with `edit_posts` capabilities. This has been changed to `manage_options`. Filters for all screens and menus have been added with this release. If you're site currently relies on users with `edit_posts` to be able to access LifterLMS settings and analytics screens you must utilize these new filters in order to maintain their access. Please see full documentation on the new filters at [https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/filters-admin-menu-and-screen-permissions](https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/filters-admin-menu-and-screen-permissions). **Please consider testing your changes outside of production before updating to LifterLMS 1.4.5 in production.**

##### Deprecations

+ Setup the `is_shop()` function to be replaced by `is_llms_shop()` function. The original causes conflicts when WooCommerce is installed as WooCommerce includes a core function by the same name. All references to `is_shop()` in LifterLMS have been removed and the original has been left to prevent issues with developers currently relying on the LifterLMS version of thefunction.
